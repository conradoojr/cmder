# Cmder

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/bliker/cmder](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/cmderdev/cmder?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Cmder is a **software package** created out of pure frustration over absence of usable console emulator on Windows. It is based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) with *major* config overhaul, adds a Monokai color scheme, integrates amazing [clink](https://github.com/mridgers/clink) and a custom prompt layout.

## Why use it

The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, that is makes it great for **USB Sticks** or **cloud storage**. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/)
2. Extract
3. (optional) Place your own executable files into the `bin` folder to be injected into your PATH.
4. Run Cmder

## Integration

So you've experimented with Cmder a little and want to give it a shot in a more permanent home;

### Shortcut to open Cmder in a chosen folder

1. Open a terminal as an Administrator
2. Navigate to the directory you have placed Cmder
3. Execute `.\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL`  
   _If you get a message "Access Denied" ensure you are executing the command in an **Administrator** prompt._

In a file explorer window right click in or on a directory to see "Cmder Here" in the context menu.

## Keyboard shortcuts

### Tab manipulation

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> : New tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?)
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> : Close tab
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> : Close tab (if pressed on empty command)
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Fast new tab: <kbd>1</kbd> - CMD, <kbd>2</kbd> - PowerShell
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Fullscreen

### Shell

* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Up</kbd> : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!)
* <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> : Traversing text with as usual on Windows
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> : History search
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Mouse : Select and copy text from buffer

(Some shortcuts are not yet documented, thought they exist, please add them here)

## Features

### Aliases
You can define simple aliases with command `alias name=command`.

For example there is one defined for you `alias e.=explorer .`

All aliases will be saved in `/config/aliases` file

### SSH Agent

To start SSH agent simply call `start-ssh-agent`, which is in the `vendor/git-for-windows/cmd` folder.

If you want to run SSH agent on startup, include the line `@call "%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd"` in `/config/user-startup.bat` (usually just uncomment it).

## Todo

1. Git Bash
2. Check for clink and git before injecting them (Sort of done)
